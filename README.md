## Open Source Solutions Architect - DevOps + MLOps

### **Skills Summary**

- As an autodidactic **self-taught programmer** and **DevOps engineer**, my journey has been one of continuous learning and adaptation. Specializing in **Python** and **JavaScript**, I've used these languages to automate processes and develop open-source projects. Through a pioneering approach, I've developed my cloud infrastructure locally, achieving nearly a 100% cost *reduction* in infrastructure expenses.

### **Skills Summary**

- As a **self-taught programmer** and **DevOps engineer**, my path has been one of continuous learning and adaptation. I've specialized in **Python** and **JavaScript** to automate processes and develop open-source projects. Through a pioneering approach, I've developed my cloud infrastructure locally, virtually eliminating infrastructure costs.
- My **containerization** expertise is showcased through my use of **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to build efficient, self-hosted development environments. This is further enhanced by opting for **MinIO for object storage** over S3 and **OpenFaaS** over Lambda. These choices exemplify my focus on cost-effective, self-hosted solutions. In **cybersecurity** and **bug bounty hunting**, I've deployed secure pipelines using **Ansible** and **custom Python scripts**.
- The dynamic field of **AI & ML** is where my unique value proposition lies. Recognizing the security concerns many companies have about integrating AI, I've developed my own secure AI inference endpoints. I also make use of local and open-source models, ensuring that data remains secure while still reaping the benefits of AI. This involves a full training and testing cycle using libraries like **Pandas**, creating actionable insights. This multi-disciplinary skill set is a testament to my resilience, innovation, and commitment to turning challenges into opportunities for growth.
