## Self-Taught Cybersecurity Experience and Projects

### Cybersecurity Development:
As a self-taught cybersecurity developer, I have developed an understanding of the Mitre ATT&CK framework and even created my own penetration testing applications for each level of the framework. My self-study has also extended to the completion of the antisyphon Mitre ATT&CK courses and passing the pre-course assessment test for "(ISC)2" cybersecurity training.

### Building Cloud Infrastructure:
Demonstrating my initiative and practical application of cybersecurity, I've developed a cloud infrastructure using open-source methods with AWS for bug bounty. This project was not just about constructing a secure environment, but also about understanding the vulnerabilities that could be exploited and how to prevent them.

### IoT and UART Hacking:
In a pursuit to understand the security aspects of everyday devices, I have worked on reverse engineering IoT hardware to learn about UART, serial connections, and data streams. I am currently learning about onboard memory and recovering firmware from these devices, aiming for obtaining root privileges.

### GitHub Contributions:
With a rating of A+ and over 200 contributions in the last 6 months, I've been active on GitHub, collaborating on open-source projects and enhancing my skills in real-world scenarios.

### Development of a CI/CD Pipeline:
To familiarize myself with the lifecycle of software development and deployment, I've built a CI/CD pipeline. The code uses AI to test and maintain production, demonstrating my understanding of the balance between development and operations in a cybersecurity context.

### Wi-Fi Recon Hardware Development:
In an effort to understand wireless network vulnerabilities, I've developed hardware for Wi-Fi reconnaissance. This hands-on project enabled me to develop and populate databases to work with, enhancing my understanding of wireless network security.

### Video Tutorials:
To share my knowledge and experience, I've created IoT and UART hacking video tutorials, which are available on my social platforms. These tutorials not only illustrate my technical skills but also my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively.

### Linux and Windows Development Platforms:
Having hands-on experience with platforms and systems commonly used by Linux and Windows developers, I've developed a solid foundation in operating systems, which is essential for understanding and exploiting their vulnerabilities.

### Practical Experience:
To ensure my skills are not just theoretical, I've created practical experiences for myself by building target and replicating environments for penetration testing. This includes implementing attacks using ESP32 microcontrollers at home, building labs in "the cloud" using Linode Cloud Computing, and building a home lab network.

Through these projects and experiences, I've developed a holistic and practical understanding of cybersecurity, positioning myself as a capable and driven penetration tester ready to face real-world challenges.
