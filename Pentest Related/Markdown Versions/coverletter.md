Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the open cybersecurity position within your organization. As a passionate, self-taught developer, I have spent countless hours studying and practicing different areas of cybersecurity and back-end web development, and I am now eager to apply these skills in a challenging and rewarding environment. 

What separates me from other candidates is not only my technical ability but also my unique blend of experiences and my aptitude for self-learning. After becoming a father to triplet boys, I was propelled into a journey of self-improvement and growth, which required immense discipline, focus, and determination. These qualities have undoubtedly shaped my approach to learning and problem-solving in the realm of IT.

Over the years, I have demonstrated my ability to learn and adapt across various industries, from running my own small businesses to working in the cabinet-making industry. Now, I am excited to pivot into the IT field, as I see it as the perfect outlet for my critical thinking, creativity, and my insatiable curiosity for how things work.

I have a solid foundation in coding languages, including BASH, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and JS, and I have a deep understanding of security methodologies and cloud security roles. I have proven my ability to apply this knowledge practically by building labs in the cloud, reverse engineering IoT hardware, and implementing attacks using microcontrollers.

However, I am not just a technical individual. I value clear communication, empathy, and the ability to challenge my own beliefs. I believe these traits, coupled with my technical skills, make me a valuable team player.

In my quest to grow my knowledge further, I am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ and Juniper (JNCIA) certifications. I am confident that these certifications, along with my practical experience, will allow me to make a significant contribution to your team.

I look forward to the possibility of bringing my unique blend of skills, experience, and passion to your organization. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
David Cannan
