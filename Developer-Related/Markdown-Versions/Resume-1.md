- **Data Analysis and Visualization with AI:** Tools like AWS Sagemaker allow me to use my serverless infrastructure and data in Jupyter Notebooks where I developed a CustomStructuredTool for langchain which allows me to interface with my bug hunting data via a conversational chat, where I can deploy containerized instances which are maintained as private github repositories  
- **Vectorizing My Everyday Data in memory:** Using libraries such as langchain and weaviate allow me to collect my regular Notion Databases and store/retrieve my Notion Integrated Databases as a vectordb.
