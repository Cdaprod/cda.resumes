# Bug Bounty Infrastructure Component

This project is a significant component of a larger tool designed for AI, focusing on creating an efficient and effective bug bounty hunting infrastructure. The main objective is to process reconnaissance data, generate useful insights, and allow easy querying and manipulation of the data using GraphQL.

## Key Features

1. **Processing Recon Results:** The infrastructure includes a mechanism to process reconnaissance data, categorize it, and generate GraphQL endpoints.

2. **GraphQL Interface:** The application provides a GraphQL interface for querying and manipulating data. The GraphQL schema includes types for recon results, domains, IPs, vulnerabilities, JavaScript files, web content, APIs, emails, users, and passwords.

3. **Prompt Templates:** The infrastructure includes prompt templates for processing domains, IP addresses, JavaScript URLs, and other categories of reconnaissance data.

4. **Custom Tools:** The application includes custom tools that are used for various tasks such as searching and processing directories of recon results. These tools are built using the langchain library.

5. **GitHub Actions and Webhooks:** The infrastructure includes a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers when a new tool is added. This workflow runs a Python script that adds the new tool to a JSON file.

6. **Google Project Deployment Manager:** The infrastructure uses Google Project Deployment Manager for deployment. It loads secrets into the environment, initializes submodules, applies Terraform, and manages Docker, Ansible, and langchain.

7. **Debugging:** The infrastructure includes a debugging mechanism using Python's built-in `logging` module.

## Architecture

The project is built using Python, and it makes use of several libraries such as Flask and langchain. It is designed to be modular and easy to extend with additional functionality.

The architecture is based on custom tools that interact with a GraphQL API. These tools perform various tasks such as processing reconnaissance data and adding new tools to the infrastructure. The GraphQL API provides an interface for querying and manipulating the data.

The GitHub Actions workflow and webhooks provide a mechanism for automatically updating the infrastructure when new tools are added. The Google Project Deployment Manager is used for deploying the infrastructure.

## Conclusion

This project is a powerful tool for bug bounty hunting, providing a variety of features and mechanisms to efficiently process reconnaissance data, generate insights, and enable easy querying and manipulation of the data. It is designed to be a robust and flexible component of a larger AI tool.
