At the age of 34, bolstered by the unwavering support of my family, I made a decisive career shift into the technology sector. I committed 10-12 hours each day to self-learning, mastering a broad array of programming languages and IT frameworks. Within just six months, I made significant strides, demonstrating the drive and resilience that I have cultivated over the years.

During this transformative period, I had the privilege to contribute to various innovative projects. For instance, I developed custom Python applications, engineered full-stack web solutions, and employed cloud-based tools like AWS for data processing infrastructure. Additionally, I self-hosted GitLab and Jenkins to gain hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines for my personal projects.

Today, I find myself on the cusp of a promising career in IT, fully prepared to apply my diverse skill set, experiences, and personal growth to any forward-thinking organization.

I am highly motivated to continue my professional development and contribute meaningfully to the tech community. If you are aware of any opportunities, or if you're in need of a resilient and rapidly evolving full-stack developer, I would be delighted to connect.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you.

Best Regards,
David Cannan
