To return the contents of a file in a GitHub repository via the GitHub API, you would use a similar URL structure to the one used to access directories, but with the path extending to the specific file you're interested in.

The structure is:

`https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path_to_file}`

Where `{owner}` is the username of the repository owner, `{repo}` is the name of the repository, and `{path_to_file}` is the path to the file you want to access.

For example, if you want to access a file named `example.txt` in the root of the repository "cda.resumes" owned by "Cdaprod", you would use:

`https://api.github.com/repos/Cdaprod/cda.resumes/contents/example.txt`

This will return a JSON object with properties about the file, including a "content" field. The "content" field contains the content of the file encoded in base64. To get the actual content of the file, you will need to decode this base64 string.

Keep in mind that URLs must be correctly encoded, and that spaces in file or directory names should be replaced with `%20`. Also, remember that the GitHub API has rate limits, especially for unauthenticated requests. If you're planning to make a lot of requests, you might need to authenticate to increase your limit.
