Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the open software developer position within your organization. Over the past six months, I have passionately dedicated myself to learning and growing as a full-stack developer. While the timeline might seem short, the intensity and dedication I've put into this journey have been significant, studying for nearly 10-12 hours a day.

The most significant motivation behind this drive is my triplet boys. Their birth marked a turning point in my life and propelled me into this journey of relentless self-improvement and growth. This journey required immense discipline, focus, and determination, qualities that I believe are integral to being a successful software developer.

I have gained a firm grasp of languages including Python, JavaScript, and have a strong understanding of CI/CD pipelines, automated AI repository dependency management, and monorepo management. I have also demonstrated my ability to apply this knowledge practically through various personal projects. I have utilized Docker in homelab development, written docker-compose files, and deployed full-stack web applications within minutes, tailoring functionality as needed.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in web app penetration testing and have completed a rigorous course with Antisyphon's Mitre ATT&CK. Additionally, my GitHub contribution rating of A+ stands as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

However, my skills are not confined to technical ability alone. I value clear communication, empathy, and the ability to challenge my own beliefs. These traits, along with my technical skills, make me a well-rounded team player.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills, experience, and passion to your organization. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

David Cannan
